#Simple chat interface

##Description

In this project, you’ll create a client-side, chat [user interface](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_interface) (UI) that enables a user to add new messages to a list. To add a new message, the user can type messages in a form and either hit the enter key, or press a “send” button.

This project will give you experience with web structure (HTML), style (CSS), coding (JavaScript), [DOM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model) Manipulation, [Version Control](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revision_control), and Form Validation. Below you’ll find resources to help you research and practice these concepts.

In order to teach you the fundamentals, do not use external libraries or third-party code for this project. No jquery, jqueryui, bootstrap, etc. Write everything from scratch!


##Development

In order to meet the requirements of the assignment the first draft of this project will be written in pure JS. As a stretch goal for this project I want to learn how to use [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/) to accomplish the same result.
